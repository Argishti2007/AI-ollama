Prompt: Generate Data base model for user profile which is not facial profile but structure in the database
Response: To generate data base model for user profile that is not facial, we can use the following steps:

1. Define a schema for the user profile table with columns for name, email, phone number, and other relevant details.
2. Create relationships between these columns to create a hierarchical structure within the table that represents the user's profile. For example, an employee's manager can have direct reports, such as team leads or supervisors.
3. Implement constraints on the user's profile schema, such as minimum and maximum length requirements for certain fields. This will help ensure that the data in the table is valid and meets business needs.
4. Use the `INSERT INTO` statement to populate the initial rows of the table with valid data. This can be done automatically by a database management tool or manually using SQL statements.
5. Implement security measures such as password hashing, role-based access controls (RBAC), and other best practices for securing user data.
6. Monitor and maintain the data base schema and ensure that it remains up to date with changes in business needs and user feedback.
